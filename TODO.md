## 1. Calendar Module Enhancements

### Conference Room Scheduling (P1) — 🤝

> **Prerequisite: You must create 2 SharePoint lists before code can be built.**

- [ ] **Create `CCSD_ConferenceRooms` list** — 👤
  1. Go to **Site Contents** > **New** > **List** > name it `CCSD_ConferenceRooms`
  2. Add these columns:
     | Column Name | Type | Notes |
     |-------------|------|-------|
     | Title | Single line (default) | Auto-generated display name |
     | RoomName | Single line of text | e.g. "Conf Room 201A" |

     | Floor | Number | Floor number |
     | Capacity | Number | Max occupants |
     | HasProjector | Yes/No | Default: No |

- [ ] **Create `CCSD_RoomReservations` list** — 👤
  1. Go to **Site Contents** > **New** > **List** > name it `CCSD_RoomReservations`
  2. Add these columns:
     | Column Name | Type | Notes |
     |-------------|------|-------|
     | Title | Single line (default) | Meeting subject |
     | ConferenceRoomID | Lookup → CCSD_ConferenceRooms | Which room |

  3. Verify the list is accessible via REST API

- [ ] **Build room availability grid** — 💻 (after lists exist)
- [ ] **Book / cancel reservation modals** — 💻
- [ ] **Recurring meeting support** — 💻
- [ ] **Conflict detection (double-booking prevention)** — 💻
- [ ] **Room search by capacity and equipment** — 💻
- [ ] **Room calendar view (per-room day/week timeline)** — 💻
- [ ] **Integration with Facilities module** — 💻

### Microsoft Graph API — Outlook Calendar Integration (P2) — 🤝

> **Requires Azure AD tenant admin actions before any code work can begin. This is likely the longest prerequisite chain in the entire TODO.**

- [ ] **Step 1: Azure AD App Registration** — 👤 (requires Global Admin or Application Admin role)
  1. Log into **Azure Portal** (portal.azure.com) with your tenant admin account
  2. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations** > click **New registration**
  3. Fill in:
     - **Name**: `CCSD Administrative SPA`
     - **Supported account types**: "Accounts in this organizational directory only"
     - **Redirect URI**: Select **Single-page application (SPA)** and enter:
       - `https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/aetc-lak-cpsg/Database/SitePages/Index.aspx`
     - Click **Register**
  4. On the app's overview page, add a second redirect URI if needed:
     - Go to **Authentication** > **Add URI** > add your dev/test site URL
  5. Go to **API permissions** > **Add a permission** > **Microsoft Graph** > **Delegated permissions**:
     - Search and add: `Calendars.Read.Shared`
     - Search and add: `User.Read`
  6. Click **Grant admin consent for [your tenant name]** (green checkmark should appear)
  7. **Copy and save these two values** (you'll give them to Claude):
     - **Application (client) ID** — on the Overview page
     - **Directory (tenant) ID** — on the Overview page

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify network access** — 👤
  1. From a workstation on the USAF network, open browser dev tools (F12) > Console
  2. Run: `fetch('https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata').then(r => console.log(r.status))`
  3. If you get a CORS error or network block, you'll need to work with your network team to whitelist `graph.microsoft.com` and `login.microsoftonline.com`
  4. **If blocked**: This feature cannot proceed — DoD networks sometimes block Graph API

- [ ] **Step 3: Provide Client ID and Tenant ID to Claude** — 👤
  - Once you have the two IDs from Step 1, share them so Claude can wire them into the APP config

- [ ] **Step 4: Build MSAL integration** — 💻 (after Step 3)
- [ ] **Step 5: Build free/busy schedule view** — 💻
- [ ] **Step 6: Add admin config panel for IDs** — 💻
- [ ] **Step 7: Token refresh and error handling** — 💻

### Calendar General Improvements (P2) — 💻

> **No prerequisites from you. These are all code-only changes.**

- [x] **Person detail page** — unified view with assets, training, time off, org chain ✅ *v2026.04.03.1*
- [ ] **Photo / avatar support** — 👤 decision needed:

## 12. External Integrations (Future) — 🤝

> **Each of these requires setup on your end before code can be built.**

### Microsoft Graph API — Outlook Calendar (P2)
- **Your steps**: See Section 1 (Azure AD App Registration) — this is the blocker
- **Claude builds**: MSAL auth, free/busy view, token management

### Power Automate — Email Notifications (P2)
- **Your steps**:
  1. Go to **Power Automate** (flow.microsoft.com) and verify you have a license
  2. Confirm you can create flows that connect to your SharePoint site
  3. Let Claude know — Claude can provide the exact flow configuration JSON or you can build manually per Section 6 instructions
- **Claude builds**: Nothing in Index.html (Power Automate runs server-side)

### SharePoint Search API — Global Search (P3)
- **Your steps**: None — SharePoint Search API is available by default on SPO
- **Claude builds**: Unified search bar using `_api/search/query`

### Teams Integration — Channel Notifications (P3)
- **Your steps**:
  1. Create an **Incoming Webhook** in the target Teams channel:
     - Open Teams > channel > **…** menu > **Connectors** > **Incoming Webhook** > name it "CCSD Admin SPA"
     - Copy the webhook URL and provide it to Claude
  2. Verify webhook URLs are not blocked by your network firewall
- **Claude builds**: POST notifications to the webhook URL on critical events

### PDF Generation (P3)
- **Your steps**: None — this uses client-side JS (jsPDF library via CDN)
- **Claude builds**: PDF export for SF182 forms, inventory reports, org charts
- **Note**: Verify that CDN scripts (cdnjs.cloudflare.com or similar) are not blocked on your network. Test by adding `<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jspdf/2.5.1/jspdf.umd.min.js"></script>` to a test page.
